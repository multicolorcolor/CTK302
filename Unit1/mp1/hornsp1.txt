Horns/antlers: Initially I made a sketch with this element that would symbolize that she identifies as Sakha person. I couldn't afford too many details with p5js shapes, so I needed a fast way to tell audience who is Suor. So I chose horns/antlers because deer is an important animal in our culture and many Sakha shamans incorporate motives of the animals or birds they're close to into their outfits. Suor is not a shaman, but she's a healer.
