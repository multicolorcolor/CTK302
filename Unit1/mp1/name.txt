Name: Suor Ij. It means Moon of Raven in Sakha language. I was also leaning towards Kunney/Kun, which means Sun. I thought it'd be funny with her personality. But I'm sticking with Suor Ij because I decided to use muted color palette for the game and character design. And I think the game might become dark.
