After I finished drawing Suor with p5js shapes, I realized that these horns/antlers are more like an element of self-exotification, maybe even self appropriation. I was even considering removing them. But then I decided that I could comment on that in the game and could leave them when she's interacting with colonizers, because colonizers will always see her as something exotic, not exactly human. But when she's by herself or interacts with other Sakha people or just normal people who are not necessarily from her culture. Who are just people who see her as a normal person, Suor will be portrayed without these horns/antlers.
