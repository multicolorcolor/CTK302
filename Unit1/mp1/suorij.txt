Name: Suor Ij. It means Moon of Raven in Sakha language. I was also leaning towards Kunney/Kun, which means Sun. I thought it'd be funny with her personality. But I'm sticking with Suor Ij because I decided to use muted color palette for the game and character design. And I think the game might become dark.                                                                                                                                                                                       Pronounces: she/her                                                                                                                                                                                       States: Right now she can walk left/right with A and D.

She starts by wanting to heal earth in her ulus that was destroyed by russian diamond mines. 
Has a passive-agressive personality.
I'm pretty sure I need to work on antagonists in this game, to decide what or who Suor fights                                                                                                                                                                                       Horns/antlers: Initially I made a sketch with this element that would symbolize that she identifies as Sakha person. I couldn't afford too many details with p5js shapes, so I needed a fast way to tell audience who is Suor. So I chose horns/antlers because deer is an important animal in our culture and many Sakha shamans incorporate motives of the animals or birds they're close to into their outfits. Suor is not a shaman, but she's a healer.                                                                                                                                                                                       After I finished drawing Suor with p5js shapes, I realized that these horns/antlers are more like an element of self-exotification, maybe even self appropriation. I was even considering removing them. But then I decided that I could comment on that in the game and could leave them when she's interacting with colonizers, because colonizers will always see her as something exotic, not exactly human. But when she's by herself or interacts with other Sakha people or just normal people who are not necessarily from her culture. Who are just people who see her as a normal person, Suor will be portrayed without these horns/antlers.                                                                                                                                                                                       And clothing. I chose modern clothing, because I wanted to indicate that the setting is modern. It was also important to me to portray her with normal anatomy free of male gaze and with normal clothing that is not bikini armor.                                                                                                                                                                                       29 hours of work log
